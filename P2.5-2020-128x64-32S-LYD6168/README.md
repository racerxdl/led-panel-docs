P2.5-2020-128x64-32S-LYD6168
============================

These panels came in with a LYD6168 PWM controller which has a know manufacturer (Leyard) but is unknown to have a public datasheet. Still, digging into some chinese software I found out that anywhere I select this panel, it actually selects the decoder ICN2053. I have tried a ICN2053 decoder and it does work fine, so this must be a OEM chip.
